# Main Functionalities

- You can add liquidity to the pool you are interested in and enter farm in the same transaction by calling `addLiquidityAndEnterFarm` function.
- You can compound your ASH rewards in the USDC/USDT pool by calling `compound` function.
- You can compound your ASH rewards in the USDC/WUSDC pool by calling `compoundUsdcWusdc` function.
- You can compound your ASH rewards in the renBTC/WBTC pool by calling `compoundBtc` function.
